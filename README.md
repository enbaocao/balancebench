# Chemical Equation Balancing Benchmark

This project provides a deterministic benchmark for evaluating the ability of large language models to balance chemical equations.

## Data

The `data.json` file contains a list of chemical equations and their corresponding smallest positive integer coefficients.

## Prompt

The `prompt.txt` file contains the specific prompt to be used when querying the language model.
